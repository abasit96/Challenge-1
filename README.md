# Challenge-1
Refactor code on an existing website for a client.

## Project Description
Horiseon web page that is fully functional but needed semantic elements in the source code to make it more accessible.  

### Criteria
The criteria upon which the source code was refactored is as follows:

User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

#### Specifics
Added a descriptive title: Changed the title from "website" to "Horiseon Refactor Source Code Challenge"
Added semantic tags such as header, nav, section, article, aside, and footer. Used the following website as a reference and resource: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp
Added alt text for images
Made the CSS code coherent after I added the semantic elements so the website can be functional. For instance, once I change the "div" tags to "nav" in the html code, I had to apply the same changes in the CSS Code.
Worked with a tutor through out the challenge to make sure the Acceptance Criteria is done.
Add files to my Github repository (https://github.com/abasit96/Challenge-1), and commited changes as I tweaked the project.
Also deployed to Github pages.
